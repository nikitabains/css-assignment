<h2>About the song</h2>
  

<p id="paragraph1" style="background-image: url('https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT6LLVa1eUF5sMBRV3NochorqD66oYipCgyjQ&usqp=CAU');">
The song <em>"Like My Father"</em> by Jax (USA) is a tribute to the <br>idea of true love founded on friendship and partnerships. The <br>chorus explicity expresses the need for a man that can offer the <br>same kind of love and care that a father showed for the singer's <br>own mother. The verses and bridge detail some of the desires the <br>singer has for a future romance: to come home to flowers,to share <br>a mutual respect and kindness, to dance in the living room like <br>young sweethearts, to take road trips in the summer, to make fun of<br> each other, and to teach their daughter the same values of true <br>love. Ultimately, the singer hopes to find a man that loves her<br> in the same way that her ownfather loves her mother..></p>

<h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
<p id="paragraph2" style="background-image: url('https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.nq9_irnpvGC8Uk_eTyiSxQHaD8&pid=Api&P=0');">I wanna come home to roses<br>
And dirty little notes on Post-its<br>
And when my hair starts turning gray<br>
He'll say I'm like a fine wine, better with age<br>
I guess I learned it from my parents<br>
That true love starts with friendship<br>
A kiss on the forehead, a date night<br>
Fake an apology after a fight<br>

<h2>[Chorus]</h2>
<p class="main">I need a man who's patient and kind<br>
Gets out of the car and holds the door<br>
I wanna slow dance in the living room like<br>
We're 18 at senior prom and grow<br>
Old with someone who makes me feel young<br>
I need a man who loves me like<br>
My father loves my mom<br>

<p id="paragraph3" style="background-image: url('https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.YxM2Ee9k4DedCiimrLlYjQHaE7&pid=Api&P=0');">I want a road trip in the summers<br>
I wanna make fun of each other<br>
I wanna rock out to Billy Joel<br>
And flip our kids off when they call us old<br>
He'll accidentally burn our dinner<br>
And let me be the scrabble winner<br>
And when my body changes shapes<br>
He'll say, "Oh my God, you look hot today"<br>

Maybe he could teach our daughter<br>
What it takes to love a queen<br>
She should know she's royalty<br>
